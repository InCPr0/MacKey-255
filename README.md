# MacKey-255

I'm a Full Stack Web Developer with more than 5 years of practical experience, located in Havana City, Cuba. I specialize in the Web, working with Python and PHP languages to which I include HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript and others; Fundamentally using different Frameworks of each of the aforementioned languages (Symfony, Django, Flask, React.JS, Bootstrap). I'm very careful in terms of design so I guarantee quality in each of my projects and a perfect adaptation to the client's needs. Apart from the Web World, I have training in the handling of Linux servers (Debian branch), desktop languages such as Java and C#, and Android for mobile devices where I stand out creating mid-range applications. I have carried out and participated in several Real Projects such as Portals, Statistics Pages, Chats, Social Networks, Forums, Blogs or any other Page of Interest, bots with web-scrapping, protection programs against hacks (Anti-Cheats), systems automated and different mobile applications. The time has allowed me to work in a group using methodologies for development and version control systems; allowing me to adapt quite well to projects and have no problem learning or adjusting to new technologies and languages. Thank you for visiting my Github profile.
